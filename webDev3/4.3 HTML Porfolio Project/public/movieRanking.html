 <h1>StarTrek Series Rankings</h1>
 <h2>My Favorite Series </h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Original StarTrek</h3>
 <p>I found the story lines about the future of AI to be fasinating.<br /> A few episodes
    echo the dark future of Elon Musks Neuro link and space travel.
 </p>
 <h3>Lower Decks</h3>
 <p>Funny! good lauaghs and most of the jokes require that the fan have watch all of the 
    other series.
 </p>
 <h3>Picard</h3>
 <p>As a fan of the 90's tri-fecta this brought a nastalgia and good tie-ins.</p>
